## Making a plan

- Google maps images
    - why? to simulate the "walk"
- Images of B&H
    - why? because that's what the quiz is about
- Some text, to give the info that will be quizzed.
- A button
- Two divs for the results of the quiz (pass/fail)

- The button will need an event listener
- The event listener will start the quiz as alerts
    - a welcome alert (alert)
    - confirmation (confirm)
    - name (prompt)
    - questions (prompts)
- I need score and a name variables
- Results strings
- And an if else to determine which result string will appear in the DOM
